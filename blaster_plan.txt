## Planned Structure of blast directory with new blaster script

D blast
D   blast-2.2.17    # The blast software
L   current         # A soft link to the current version of the blast software, in case we use more than one
D   db              # The blast database directory
D     FASTA         # db subdirectory containing fasta formatted database files
D   bin             # Directory containing all my scripts
D     blaster       # subdirectory containing the blaster program
F       blaster.rb  # the main program for slicing genomes into 40mers, 
                    #     screening, blasting, and binning probe candidates
F       config.yaml # config file for blaster.rb and subprograms
D       lib         # Directory containing Ruby class files for subprograms of blaster.rb
D       test        # Directory containing Ruby Test::Unit test files for methods of blaster and classes
D   data            # Directory containing input data used by blaster.rb
F     bacteria.yaml # Structured list of bacteria to blast, each identified by NC_ID, genus, and species
D     genome_fastas # Directory containing all fasta files for genomes to blast
F       NC_XXXXXXX.fna # each bacterium will have one of these fasta files named by ID
D   results         # Directory containing output of blaster.rb
D       NC_XXXXXXX_genus_species_strain  # each organism will have a name directory for its results
F         NC_XXXXXXX_human_bin  # bin file for human matches (if it has a good match to human)
F         NC_XXXXXXX_other_bin  # bin file for other matches 
                                #(if no good match to human but good match to something else)
F         NC_XXXXXXX_genus_bin  # bin file for genus matches (only good matches to same genus and species)
F         NC_XXXXXXX_species_bin # bin file for species matches (only good match to same species)
F         NC_XXXXXXX_blast_candidates.fasta # fasta file of 40mers created after screen
F         NC_XXXXXXX_blast_candidates_after_human.fasta # fasta file of 40mers remaining after human bin pulled out

D   logs            # log files of runs of blaster.rb     
F     run_log_<datetime>.log  # Each run will generate a log id'ed by date and time of start




USAGE (some details could vary):
Place fasta files properly named into genome_fastas directory.
Place bacteria.yaml file containing formatted list of bacteria to run into data directory.
Check and possibly edit config.yaml for conditions
Change directory (cd) to blast/bin/blaster
Run the program with "./blaster.rb"
Observe progress by using tail on the blast results files & reading command line feedback.
When it completes, examine bin files in the results folders.

Status:

blaster.rb basically done
bacterium.rb bin_human and later methods to write, needs lots of tests
blast_hash.rb   tests to fill in
my_dna.rb tests complete
blast_flora.rb created from BlastFlora class pulled out of blaster.rb, has some test assertions, could use more.
Fixed several scoping bugs related to classes needing require statements, attr_accessors and formatting of some references.
Might look in later and see if attr_accessors can be trimmed back to attr_readers

Installed blast and dbs on laptop for use in testing
Installed git on sgtc-rails
copied project over to sgtc-rails using git

3/12/08 bug fixing and running to test - got it running blaster.rb up to first blast results, including dir creation and file generation

Tasks:
Download genomes
Fill in bacteria.yaml
Parse the "other" blast results
Flesh out other tests
