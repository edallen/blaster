Blaster README
The Blaster project is copyright 2008, 2009, Stanford University, released as open source under the MIT license. 

Will make a proper README later. For now, the blaster_poster.ppt file
 (I know, ugh, Powerpoint...) has the best documentation on the project. The
file blaster_plan.txt has some older working notes to myself that may be 
useful as well.

As will be evident in the code, this was a "my first big ruby script outside
of Rails" and I would have refactored the code quite a bit, finished more tests,
etc, had my time at Stanford continued long enough for me to get back to it. 
But it does run and called a lot of good probes that Richard Hyman had synthesized
 and used successfully.
